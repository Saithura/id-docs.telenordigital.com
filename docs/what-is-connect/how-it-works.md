CONNECT is an easy and secure authentication and payment solution developed for Telenor by Telenor Digital. It involves the process of **signing in** and **managing the account.**

CONNECT is open to users of all services and stays relevant in a user’s life even after they have churned from Telenor — non-Telenor subscribers also have the ability to register and use CONNECT.

CONNECT is designed to be used in a browser or in-app browser tab in order to ensure:
-   Consistent user experience between services that use CONNECT
-   [Single Sign On](./single-sign-on.html) (SSO)
-   Easy updating and maintenance
-   High level of security
-   It provides easy integration
-   A single CONNECT account belongs to a single user
-   You can sign in using phone number or email address
-   You can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses to a single CONNECT account
-   An email address or phone number present only on one account at a time
-   There is no relationship between different CONNECT accounts
