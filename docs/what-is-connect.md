CONNECT is easy and secure authentication and payment solution developed for Telenor by Telenor Digital. It involves the process of **signing in** and **managing the account.**

CONNECT is open to users of all services and stays relevant in user’s life even after they have churned from Telenor — non-Telenor subscribers also have the ability to register and use CONNECT.
