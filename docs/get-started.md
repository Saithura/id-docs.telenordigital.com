## Register client
Before being able to use CONNECT ID in your application, you first need to [register a client](./get-started/register-client.md).


## Native applications
The easiest way to integrate CONNECT ID with your native app is to use our SDKs.
Currently, we only provide SDKs for Android and iOS, see the subsections below for details.
If you are not using Android or iOS, please refer to our old documentation at
[docs.telenordigital.com](http://docs.telenordigital.com/).
